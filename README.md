# Personal Portfolio Website
My personal project portfolio website created using a [template](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate) and following a tutorial by [Jacob Chishom](https://github.com/Jchisholm204) on his portfolio, the article can be found [here](https://jchisholm204.github.io/posts/PD_jekyll_workshop/).
